/// An abstract set of layout constraints.
///
/// Concrete layout models (such as box) will create concrete subclasses to
/// communicate layout constraints between parents and children.
///
/// ## Writing a Constraints subclass
///
/// When creating a new [RenderObject] subclass with a new layout protocol, one
/// will usually need to create a new [Constraints] subclass to express the
/// input to the layout algorithms.
///
/// A [Constraints] subclass should be immutable (all fields final). There are
/// several members to implement, in addition to whatever fields, constructors,
/// and helper methods one may find useful for a particular layout protocol:
///
/// * The [isTight] getter, which should return true if the object represents a
///   case where the [RenderObject] class has no choice for how to lay itself
///   out. For example, [BoxConstraints] returns true for [isTight] when both
///   the minimum and maximum widths and the minimum and maximum heights are
///   equal.
///
/// * The [isNormalized] getter, which should return true if the object
///   represents its data in its canonical form. Sometimes, it is possible for
///   fields to be redundant with each other, such that several different
///   representations have the same implications. For example, a
///   [BoxConstraints] instance with its minimum width greater than its maximum
///   width is equivalent to one where the maximum width is set to that minimum
///   width (`2<w<1` is equivalent to `2<w<2`, since minimum constraints have
///   priority). This getter is used by the default implementation of
///   [debugAssertIsValid].
///
/// * The [debugAssertIsValid] method, which should assert if there's anything
///   wrong with the constraints object. (We use this approach rather than
///   asserting in constructors so that our constructors can be `const` and so
///   that it is possible to create invalid constraints temporarily while
///   building valid ones.) See the implementation of
///   [BoxConstraints.debugAssertIsValid] for an example of the detailed checks
///   that can be made.
///
/// * The [==] operator and the [hashCode] getter, so that constraints can be
///   compared for equality. If a render object is given constraints that are
///   equal, then the rendering library will avoid laying the object out again
///   if it is not dirty.
///
/// * The [toString] method, which should describe the constraints so that they
///   appear in a usefully readable form in the output of [debugDumpRenderTree].

/// 1. [flushLayout] updates any render objects that need to compute their

///    compositing bits. During this phase, each render object learns whether
///    any of its children require compositing. This information is used during
///    the painting phase when selecting how to implement visual effects such as
///    clipping. If a render object has a composited child, it needs to use a
///    [Layer] to create the clip in order for the clip to apply to the
///    composited child (which will be painted into its own [Layer]).
/// 3. [flushPaint] visits any render objects that need to paint. During this
///    phase, render objects get a chance to record painting commands into
///    [PictureLayer]s and construct other composited [Layer]s.
/// 4. Finally, if semantics are enabled, [flushSemantics] will compile the
///    semantics for the render objects. This semantic information is used by
///    assistive technology to improve the accessibility of the render tree.

///
/// [RenderObject]s have a [parent], and have a slot called [parentData] in
/// which the parent [RenderObject] can store child-specific data, for example,
/// the child position. The [RenderObject] class also implements the basic
/// layout and paint protocols.
///
/// The [RenderObject] class, however, does not define a child model (e.g.
/// whether a node has zero, one, or more children). It also doesn't define a
/// coordinate system (e.g. whether children are positioned in Cartesian
/// coordinates, in polar coordinates, etc) or a specific layout protocol (e.g.
/// whether the layout is width-in-height-out, or constraint-in-size-out, or
/// whether the parent sets the size and position of the child before or after
/// the child lays out, etc; or indeed whether the children are allowed to read
/// their parent's [parentData] slot).
///
/// The [RenderBox] subclass introduces the opinion that the layout
/// system uses Cartesian coordinates.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// A [RenderObject] must [dispose] when it is no longer needed. The creator
/// of the object is responsible for disposing of it. Typically, the creator is
/// a [RenderObjectElement], and that element will dispose the object it creates
/// when it is unmounted.
///
/// [RenderObject]s are responsible for cleaning up any expensive resources
/// they hold when [dispose] is called, such as [Picture] or [Image] objects.
/// This includes any [Layer]s that the render object has directly created. The
/// base implementation of dispose will nullify the [layer] property. Subclasses
/// must also nullify any other layer(s) it directly creates.
///
/// ## Writing a RenderObject subclass
///
/// In most cases, subclassing [RenderObject] itself is overkill, and
/// [RenderBox] would be a better starting point. However, if a render object
/// doesn't want to use a Cartesian coordinate system, then it should indeed
/// inherit from [RenderObject] directly. This allows it to define its own
/// layout protocol by using a new subclass of [Constraints] rather than using
/// [BoxConstraints], and by potentially using an entirely new set of objects
/// and values to represent the result of the output rather than just a [Size].
/// This increased flexibility comes at the cost of not being able to rely on
/// the features of [RenderBox]. For example, [RenderBox] implements an
/// intrinsic sizing protocol that allows you to measure a child without fully
/// laying it out, in such a way that if that child changes size, the parent
/// will be laid out again (to take into account the new dimensions of the
/// child). This is a subtle and bug-prone feature to get right.
///
/// Most aspects of writing a [RenderBox] apply to writing a [RenderObject] as
/// well, and therefore the discussion at [RenderBox] is recommended background
/// reading. The main differences are around layout and hit testing, since those
/// are the aspects that [RenderBox] primarily specializes.
///
/// ### Layout
///
/// A layout protocol begins with a subclass of [Constraints]. See the
/// discussion at [Constraints] for more information on how to write a
/// [Constraints] subclass.
///
/// The [performLayout] method should take the [constraints], and apply them.
/// The output of the layout algorithm is fields set on the object that describe
/// the geometry of the object for the purposes of the parent's layout. For
/// example, with [RenderBox] the output is the [RenderBox.size] field. This
/// output should only be read by the parent if the parent specified
/// `parentUsesSize` as true when calling [layout] on the child.
///
/// Anytime anything changes on a render object that would affect the layout of
/// that object, it should call [markNeedsLayout].
///
/// ### Hit Testing
///
/// Hit testing is even more open-ended than layout. There is no method to
/// override, you are expected to provide one.
///
/// The general behavior of your hit-testing method should be similar to the
/// behavior described for [RenderBox]. The main difference is that the input
/// need not be an [Offset]. You are also allowed to use a different subclass of
/// [HitTestEntry] when adding entries to the [HitTestResult]. When the
/// [handleEvent] method is called, the same object that was added to the
/// [HitTestResult] will be passed in, so it can be used to track information
/// like the precise coordinate of the hit, in whatever coordinate system is
/// used by the new layout protocol.
///
/// ### Adapting from one protocol to another
///
/// In general, the root of a Flutter render object tree is a [RenderView]. This
/// object has a single child, which must be a [RenderBox]. Thus, if you want to
/// have a custom [RenderObject] subclass in the render tree, you have two
/// choices: you either need to replace the [RenderView] itself, or you need to
/// have a [RenderBox] that has your class as its child. (The latter is the much
/// more common case.)
///
/// This [RenderBox] subclass converts from the box protocol to the protocol of
/// your class.
///
/// In particular, this means that for hit testing it overrides
/// [RenderBox.hitTest], and calls whatever method you have in your class for
/// hit testing.
///
/// Similarly, it overrides [performLayout] to create a [Constraints] object
/// appropriate for your class and passes that to the child's [layout] method.
///
/// ### Layout interactions between render objects
///
/// In general, the layout of a render object should only depend on the output of
/// its child's layout, and then only if `parentUsesSize` is set to true in the
/// [layout] call. Furthermore, if it is set to true, the parent must call the
/// child's [layout] if the child is to be rendered, because otherwise the
/// parent will not be notified when the child changes its layout outputs.
///
/// It is possible to set up render object protocols that transfer additional
/// information. For example, in the [RenderBox] protocol you can query your
/// children's intrinsic dimensions and baseline geometry. However, if this is
/// done then it is imperative that the child call [markNeedsLayout] on the
/// parent any time that additional information changes, if the parent used it
/// in the last layout phase. For an example of how to implement this, see the
/// [RenderBox.markNeedsLayout] method. It overrides
/// [RenderObject.markNeedsLayout] so that if a parent has queried the intrinsic
/// or baseline information, it gets marked dirty whenever the child's geometry
/// changes.

  /// render object children when computing its layout information, this
  /// function, when called for the child, will also mark the parent as needing
  /// layout. In that case, since both the parent and the child need to have
  /// their layout recomputed, the pipeline owner is only notified about the

  ///
  /// Once [markNeedsLayout] has been called on a render object,
  /// [debugNeedsLayout] returns true for that render object until just after
  /// the pipeline owner has called [layout] on the render object.

  ///
  /// Some subclasses of [RenderObject], notably [RenderBox], have other
  /// situations in which the parent needs to be notified if the child is
  /// dirtied (e.g., if the child's intrinsic dimensions or baseline changes).
  /// Such subclasses override markNeedsLayout and either call
  /// `super.markNeedsLayout()`, in the normal case, or call
  /// [markParentNeedsLayout], in the case where the parent needs to be laid out
  /// as well as the child.
